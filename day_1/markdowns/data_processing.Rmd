In this tuturial, you will learn how to take the raw sequencing files in `fastq` format, and convert them into alignment files in `bam` format. Along the way, you will perform multiple quality control (QC) procedures, and will map the short sequences to a reference genome. 

## Initial preparations

#### Get familiarized with some basic shell scripting

If you have not used shell scripting before or are getting rusty on it, it may be helpful to have a look at a cheat sheet before proceeding to the next step. 

Example cheat sheets:

#### Create a project directory

As a first step, you should create a project directory (referred to as `BASEDIR` in certain scripts), which you can name `day_1`, with the following subdirectories:
  
  * `raw_fastq` raw fastq files
  
  * `adapter_clipped` adapter clipped fastq files
  
  * `bam` bam files
  
  * `sample_lists` sample tables, sample lists, and other small text files
  
  * `fastqc` FastQC output
  
  * `markdowns` RMarkdown and Markdown files

> Hint: New directories can be created using the `mkdir` command in Unix shell.

#### Move data to appropriate directories

* Move raw fastq files to the `raw_fastq` folder.

* Move the fasta file of the reference genome (`mme_physalia_testdata_chr24.fa`) and the Nextera adapter file (`NexteraPE_NT.fa`) to the `reference` folder

#### Create a sample list

A sample list is a list of the prefixes of raw fastq files. These should be unique for each fastq file, and the rest of the names have to be the same for all raw fastq files. No header should be included in this list. 

For this excercise, the sample list looks like the following. 

```
11665X131
11665X134
11665X135
11665X136
11665X50
```

You can save this list to a file named `sample_list.txt` under the `sample_lists` directory.

> Hint: You can use the `nano` command to edit text files in Unix shell. You can also use the `echo` command to directly write content to a file. 

#### Prepare a sample table

A sample table is a **tab deliminated** table that includes relevant information for all fastq files. It should include the following six columns, strictly in this order:

  * `prefix` prefix of raw fastq files; these should match the entries in the sample list
  
  * `lane_number` lane number; each sequencing lane should be assigned a different number
  
  * `seq_id` sequence IDï¼Œthis can be the same thing as sample ID or lane ID and it does not matter except for when different libraries were prepared out of the same sample and were run in the same lane. In this case, seq_id should be used to distinguish these.
  
  * `sample_id` sample ID
  
  * `population` population name
  
  * `data_type` data type; there can only be two possible entries: `pe` (for paired-end data) or `se` (for single end data)

It is important to make sure that the combination of lane_number, seq_id, and sample_id has to be unique for each fastq file. 

For this excercise, the sample table looks like the following. 

```
prefix	lane_number	seq_id	sample_id	population	data_type
11665X131	lane9	1	JekyllIs_1068	JekyllIs	pe
11665X134	lane9	2	JekyllIs_1072	JekyllIs	pe
11665X135	lane9	3	JekyllIs_1073	JekyllIs	pe
11665X136	lane9	4	JekyllIs_1074	JekyllIs	pe
11665X50	lane1	5	JekyllIs_1034	JekyllIs	pe
```

You can save this table to a file named `sample_table.tsv` under the `sample_lists` directory.

## Data processing pipeline

#### Examine the raw fastq files

###### fastq file structure

A FASTQ file normally uses four lines per sequence.

  * Line 1 contains the sequence identifier, with information on the sequencing run and the cluster. The exact content of this line varies depending on how fastq files are generated from the sequencer.
  * Line 2 is the raw sequence. 
  * Line 3 often consists of a single `+` symbol. 
  * Line 4 encodes the quality of each base in the sequence in Line 2 (i.e. the probability of sequencing error in log scale). For most sequencers, these base qualities are encoded in the [Phred33 format](https://drive5.com/usearch/manual/quality_score.html). 

Now read the code below, guess what it does, and run it on your own. Does it do what you expect it to do? Inspect the output and try to identify the group of four lines for each read. 

> Hint: make sure that you change the `BASEDIR` path to your own base directory.

```{bash eval=F}
BASEDIR=/workdir/physalia-lcwgs/day_1/ # Path to the base directory / project directory.
SAMPLELIST=$BASEDIR/sample_lists/sample_list.txt # Path to the sample list.
RAWFASTQSUFFIX1=_Paired_NoCont_1.fastq.gz # Suffix to raw fastq files. Use forward reads with paired-end data.
for SAMPLE in `cat $SAMPLELIST`; do
  echo $SAMPLE
  zcat $BASEDIR'raw_fastq/'$SAMPLE$RAWFASTQSUFFIX1 | head -n 4
  echo ' '
done
```

###### FastQC report

Run the FastQC program on your fastq files to check the quality of these files. 

```{bash eval=F}
BASEDIR=/workdir/physalia-lcwgs/day_1/
FASTQC=/programs/bin/fastqc/fastqc
SAMPLELIST=$BASEDIR/sample_lists/sample_list.txt # Path to a list of prefixes of the raw fastq files. It should be a subset of the the 1st column of the sample table.
RAWFASTQSUFFIX1=_Paired_NoCont_1.fastq.gz # Suffix to raw fastq files. Use forward reads with paired-end data.
RAWFASTQSUFFIX2=_Paired_NoCont_2.fastq.gz # Suffix to raw fastq files. Use reverse reads with paired-end data.

for SAMPLE in `cat $SAMPLELIST`; do
  $FASTQC $BASEDIR'raw_fastq/'$SAMPLE$RAWFASTQSUFFIX1 -o $BASEDIR'fastqc/'
  $FASTQC $BASEDIR'raw_fastq/'$SAMPLE$RAWFASTQSUFFIX2 -o $BASEDIR'fastqc/'
done
```

#### Adapter clipping

When the insert length of a library fragment is shorter than the read length, the adapters would be incorporated into the sequencing reads (as shown below), which may lead to lower alignment performance and even biases in the result if not removed.  

![](https://www.ecseq.com/support/ngs/img/fragmentsize.png)

Here, we use Trimmomatic to clip the adapter sequences. This step require us to input the known adapter sequences that we used when preparing the libraries (`ADAPTERS`). In this exercise, the libraries were prepared using the Nextera kit (NexteraPE_NT.fa).

```{bash eval=F}
BASEDIR=/workdir/physalia-lcwgs/day_1/
TRIMMOMATIC=/programs/trimmomatic/trimmomatic-0.39.jar
SAMPLELIST=$BASEDIR/sample_lists/sample_list.txt # Path to a list of prefixes of the raw fastq files. It should be a subset of the the 1st column of the sample table.
SAMPLETABLE=$BASEDIR/sample_lists/sample_table.tsv # Path to a sample table where the 1st column is the prefix of the raw fastq files. The 4th column is the sample ID, the 2nd column is the lane number, and the 3rd column is sequence ID. The combination of these three columns have to be unique. The 6th column should be data type, which is either pe or se. 
RAWFASTQDIR=$BASEDIR/raw_fastq/ # Path to raw fastq files. 
RAWFASTQSUFFIX1=_Paired_NoCont_1.fastq.gz # Suffix to raw fastq files. Use forward reads with paired-end data.
RAWFASTQSUFFIX2=_Paired_NoCont_2.fastq.gz # Suffix to raw fastq files. Use reverse reads with paired-end data. 
ADAPTERS=$BASEDIR/reference/NexteraPE_NT.fa # Path to a list of adapter/index sequences.

## Loop over each sample
for SAMPLEFILE in `cat $SAMPLELIST`; do
	
	## Extract relevant values from a table of sample, sequencing, and lane ID (here in columns 4, 3, 2, respectively) for each sequenced library
	SAMPLE_ID=`grep -P "${SAMPLEFILE}\t" $SAMPLETABLE | cut -f 4`
	SEQ_ID=`grep -P "${SAMPLEFILE}\t" $SAMPLETABLE | cut -f 3`
	LANE_ID=`grep -P "${SAMPLEFILE}\t" $SAMPLETABLE | cut -f 2`
	SAMPLE_SEQ_ID=$SAMPLE_ID'_'$SEQ_ID'_'$LANE_ID  # When a sample has been sequenced in multiple lanes, we need to be able to identify the files from each run uniquely
	
	## Extract data type from the sample table
	DATATYPE=`grep -P "${SAMPLEFILE}\t" $SAMPLETABLE | cut -f 6`
	
	## The input and output path and file prefix
	RAWFASTQ_ID=$RAWFASTQDIR$SAMPLEFILE
	SAMPLEADAPT=$BASEDIR'adapter_clipped/'$SAMPLE_SEQ_ID
	
	## Adapter clip the reads with Trimmomatic
	# The options for ILLUMINACLIP are: ILLUMINACLIP:<fastaWithAdaptersEtc>:<seed mismatches>:<palindrome clip threshold>:<simple clip threshold>:<minAdapterLength>:<keepBothReads>

	if [ $DATATYPE = pe ]; then
		java -jar $TRIMMOMATIC PE -threads 18 -phred33 $RAWFASTQ_ID$RAWFASTQSUFFIX1 $RAWFASTQ_ID$RAWFASTQSUFFIX2 $SAMPLEADAPT'_adapter_clipped_f_paired.fastq.gz' $SAMPLEADAPT'_adapter_clipped_f_unpaired.fastq.gz' $SAMPLEADAPT'_adapter_clipped_r_paired.fastq.gz' $SAMPLEADAPT'_adapter_clipped_r_unpaired.fastq.gz' 'ILLUMINACLIP:'$ADAPTERS':2:30:10:1:true'
	
	elif [ $DATATYPE = se ]; then
		java -jar $TRIMMOMATIC SE -threads 18 -phred33 $RAWFASTQ_ID$RAWFASTQSUFFIX1 $SAMPLEADAPT'_adapter_clipped_se.fastq.gz' 'ILLUMINACLIP:'$ADAPTERS':2:30:10'
	fi
	
done
```

#### Build reference index files 

Prior to sequence alignment, we will first build the reference index files that are required by the alignment software `bowtie2`.

```{bash eval=F}
PICARD=/programs/picard-tools-2.19.2/picard.jar
SAMTOOLS=/programs/bin/samtools/samtools
BOWTIEBUILD=/programs/bin/bowtie2/bowtie2-build
BASEDIR=/workdir/physalia-lcwgs/day_1/
REFERENCE=$BASEDIR/reference/mme_physalia_testdata_chr24.fa
REFBASENAME="${REFERENCE%.*}"
$SAMTOOLS faidx $REFERENCE
java -jar $PICARD CreateSequenceDictionary R=$REFERENCE O=$REFBASENAME'.dict'
$BOWTIEBUILD $REFERENCE $REFBASENAME
```

#### Map to reference, sort, and quality filter

In this step, we align each fastq file to the reference genome using `bowtie2`. The resulting alignment file, in `sam` format, will be converted to a binary format `bam` for more efficient storage. We will then filter out the reads with a mapping quality lower than 20, and sort the filtered alignment file for easier computation in the next step. 

```{bash eval=F}
BOWTIE=/programs/bin/bowtie2/bowtie2
SAMTOOLS=/programs/bin/samtools/samtools
BASEDIR=/workdir/physalia-lcwgs/day_1/
SAMPLELIST=$BASEDIR/sample_lists/sample_list.txt # Path to a list of prefixes of the raw fastq files. It should be a subset of the the 1st column of the sample table.
SAMPLETABLE=$BASEDIR/sample_lists/sample_table.tsv # Path to a sample table where the 1st column is the prefix of the raw fastq files. The 4th column is the sample ID, the 2nd column is the lane number, and the 3rd column is sequence ID. The combination of these three columns have to be unique. The 6th column should be data type, which is either pe or se. 
FASTQDIR=$BASEDIR/adapter_clipped/ # Path to the directory where fastq file are stored. 
FASTQSUFFIX1=_adapter_clipped_f_paired.fastq.gz # Suffix to fastq files. Use forward reads with paired-end data. 
FASTQSUFFIX2=_adapter_clipped_r_paired.fastq.gz # Suffix to fastq files. Use reverse reads with paired-end data. 
MAPPINGPRESET=very-sensitive # The pre-set option to use for mapping in bowtie2 (very-sensitive for end-to-end (global) mapping [typically used when we have a full genome reference], very-sensitive-local for partial read mapping that allows soft-clipping [typically used when mapping genomic reads to a transcriptome]
REFERENCE=$BASEDIR/reference/mme_physalia_testdata_chr24.fa # Path to reference fasta file and file name
REFNAME=mme_physalia_testdata_chr24 # Reference name to add to output files, e.g. gadMor2

## Loop over each sample
for SAMPLEFILE in `cat $SAMPLELIST`; do
	
	## Extract relevant values from a table of sample, sequencing, and lane ID (here in columns 4, 3, 2, respectively) for each sequenced library
	SAMPLE_ID=`grep -P "${SAMPLEFILE}\t" $SAMPLETABLE | cut -f 4`
	SEQ_ID=`grep -P "${SAMPLEFILE}\t" $SAMPLETABLE | cut -f 3`
	LANE_ID=`grep -P "${SAMPLEFILE}\t" $SAMPLETABLE | cut -f 2`
	SAMPLE_SEQ_ID=$SAMPLE_ID'_'$SEQ_ID'_'$LANE_ID
	
	## Extract data type from the sample table
	DATATYPE=`grep -P "${SAMPLEFILE}\t" $SAMPLETABLE | cut -f 6`

	## Map reads to the reference 
	# Map the paired-end reads
	if [ $DATATYPE = pe ]; then 
	# We ignore the reads that get orphaned during adapter clipping because that is typically a very small proportion of reads. If a large proportion of reads get orphaned (loose their mate so they become single-end), these can be mapped in a separate step and the resulting bam files merged with the paired-end mapped reads.

done
```

#### Examine the bam files

SAM stands for Sequence Alignment/Map format. It is a TAB-delimited text format consisting of a header section, which is optional, and an alignment section. If present, the header must be prior to the alignments. Header lines start with â€˜@â€™, while alignment lines do not. Each alignment line has 11 mandatory fields for essential alignment information such as mapping position, and variable number of optional fields for flexible or aligner specific information. BAM is the binary version of the SAM format. 
You can use commands in the format of `$SAMTOOLS view $SAMPLEBAM'_'$DATATYPE'_bt2_'$REFNAME'_minq20_sorted.bam' | head -n 1` to inspect the first alignment of a bam file. Write a loop on your own to print the first alignment of all five sorted bam files that you have generated in the last step.

#### Merge samples that were sequenced multiple times and generate a merged sample table and bam list

We need a new sample table, because prior to merging, each row represent a fastq file, but after merging, each row represent a unique sample. The merged sample table also has a slightly different formatting. 

In this example, we don't have any samples that were sequenced multiple times, but we still need to generate a new sample table with different formatting. We will do this in R. 

```{r eval=F}
library(tidyverse)
## Define base directory and reference name
basedir <- "/workdir/physalia-lcwgs/day_1/"
refname <- "mme_physalia_testdata_chr24"
## Read in unmerged sample tables and combine pe and se
sample_table_merged <- read_tsv(paste0("../sample_lists/sample_table.tsv")) %>%
  mutate(sample_seq_id=paste(sample_id,seq_id,lane_number, data_type, sep = "_")) %>%
  select(sample_seq_id, lane_number, seq_id, sample_id, population, data_type)
write_tsv(sample_table_merged, paste0("../sample_lists/sample_table_merged.tsv"))
bam_list_merged <- paste0(basedir, "bam/", sample_table_merged$sample_seq_id, "_bt2_", refname, "_minq20_sorted.bam")
bam_list_dedup_overlapclipped <- transmute(sample_table_merged, suffix=ifelse(data_type=="se", paste0("_bt2_", refname, "_minq20_sorted_dedup.bam"), paste0("_bt2_", refname, "_minq20_sorted_dedup_overlapclipped.bam"))) %>%
  .$suffix %>%
  paste0(basedir, "bam/", sample_table_merged$sample_seq_id, .)
bam_list_realigned <- transmute(sample_table_merged, suffix=ifelse(data_type=="se", paste0("_bt2_", refname, "_minq20_sorted_dedup_realigned.bam"), paste0("_bt2_", refname, "_minq20_sorted_dedup_overlapclipped_realigned.bam"))) %>%
  .$suffix %>%
  paste0(basedir, "bam/", sample_table_merged$sample_seq_id, .)
write_lines(bam_list_merged, paste0("../sample_lists/bam_list_merged.txt"))
write_lines(bam_list_dedup_overlapclipped, paste0("../sample_lists/bam_list_dedup_overlapclipped.txt"))
write_lines(bam_list_realigned, paste0("../sample_lists/bam_list_realigned.txt"))
```

#### Deduplicate (all samples) and clip overlapping read pairs (pair-end reads only)

Here, we remove the PCR duplicates and trim the overlapping part of each read pair in pair-end data. It is important to deduplicate after merging, because PCR duplicates for the same sample may exist in different lanes. 

![](https://i.stack.imgur.com/7dkOV.png)

```{bash eval=F}
PICARD=/programs/picard-tools-2.19.2/picard.jar
BAMUTIL=/programs/bamUtil/bam
BASEDIR=/workdir/physalia-lcwgs/day_1/
BAMLIST=$BASEDIR/sample_lists/bam_list_merged.txt # Path to a list of merged bam files.

The 4th column is the sample ID, the 2nd column is the lane number, and the 3rd column is sequence ID. The 5th column is population name and 6th column is the data type.
REFNAME=mme_physalia_testdata_chr24 # Reference name to add to output files

## Loop over each sample
for SAMPLEBAM in `cat $BAMLIST`; do
	
	## Extract the file name prefix for this sample
	SAMPLEPREFIX=`echo $SAMPLEBAM | sed 's/_bt2_.*//' | sed -e 's#.*/bam/\(\)#\1#'`
	
	## Remove duplicates and print dupstat file
	# We used to be able to just specify picard.jar on the CBSU server, but now we need to specify the path and version
	java -Xmx60g -jar $PICARD MarkDuplicates I=$SAMPLEBAM O=$BASEDIR'bam/'$SAMPLEPREFIX'_bt2_'$REFNAME'_minq20_sorted_dedup.bam' M=$BASEDIR'bam/'$SAMPLEPREFIX'_bt2_'$REFNAME'_minq20_sorted_dupstat.txt' VALIDATION_STRINGENCY=SILENT REMOVE_DUPLICATES=true
	
	## Extract data type from the merged sample table
	DATATYPE=`grep -P "${SAMPLEPREFIX}\t" $SAMPLETABLE | cut -f 6`
	
	if [ $DATATYPE != se ]; then
		## Clip overlapping paired end reads (only necessary for paired end data)
		$BAMUTIL clipOverlap --in $BASEDIR'bam/'$SAMPLEPREFIX'_bt2_'$REFNAME'_minq20_sorted_dedup.bam' --out $BASEDIR'bam/'$SAMPLEPREFIX'_bt2_'$REFNAME'_minq20_sorted_dedup_overlapclipped.bam' --stats
	fi
	
done
```

#### In-del relignment

It is difficult to distinguish in-dels from SNPs at the end of reads if each read is considered separately. Therefore, in this step, we take all the aligned sequences from all samples in to account to validate the in-dels discovered from the mapping process.

```{bash eval=F}
## Use an older version of Java

for SAMPLEBAM in `cat $BAMLIST`; do

	echo "the file already exists"

done
